//The interns at Amazon were asked to review the company's stock value over a period.
// Given the stock prices of n months, the net price change for the ùëñùë°‚Ñéith month is
// defined as the absolute difference between the average of stock prices for the first
// i months and for the remaining (n - i) months where 1‚â§ùëñ<ùëõ1‚â§i<n. Note that these
// averages are rounded down to an integer.Given an array of stock prices, find the
// month at which the net price change is minimum. If there are several such months,
// return the earliest month.Note: The average of a set of integers here is defined as
// the sum of integers divided by the number of integers, rounded down to the nearest
// integer. For example, the average of [1, 2, 3, 4] is the floor of
// (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5 and the floor of 2.5 is 2.
